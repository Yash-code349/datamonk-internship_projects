# Reflect on This – Foundation > 01_linux

## 1. Main goal of this task
The main goal of this task was to learn basic Linux commands through the terminal. I explored how to navigate the file system, search for files, compress them, and also take screenshots of my work. Submitting everything on GitHub was also a part of the learning.

---

## 2. New Linux concepts I learn
I learned many new things like:
- Using `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls` to move between directories and view files
- Creating and deleting folders with `mkdir` and `rm`
- Searching using `find` and `grep`
- Compressing files using `tar` and `zip`
- Understanding the difference between absolute and relative paths

---

## 3. What problems did I face while completing the task?
At first, I got confused because I moved my screenshots into the folder, but they didn’t show up in the terminal.  
Also, when I tried to push files to GitHub, it asked for username and password. Once, my folder name was typed incorrectly, and the `cd` command didn’t work.

---

## 4. What would I do differently next time
- I’ll plan folder and screenshot names better
- I’ll verify each step before going ahead
- I’ll check my GitHub repo after pushing to make sure everything is visible

---

## 5. How do I feel after completing the task
I feel happy because Linux and GitHub seemed difficult at first, but now I can use basic commands and push files confidently.  
This was my first Linux hands-on experience, and it really gave me confidence.
