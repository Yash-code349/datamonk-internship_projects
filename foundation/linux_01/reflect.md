# Reflect on This – Secure Shared Project Directory

## What did I learn?
While doing this project, I learned how to manage users and set up file and folder permissions in Linux. Before this, I didn’t fully understand how `chown` or `chmod` works, but now I get how ownership and group access help in real teamwork situations. It was interesting to see how Linux allows precise control over who can read, write, or execute a file.

## What challenges did I face?
I faced a few small but frustrating issues, like trying to access a folder that didn’t exist because I had created it in the wrong user’s home directory. Also, remembering to switch between users properly using `su - dev_user` and setting the right permissions with `chmod 760` needed attention. But step-by-step checking using `ls -l` helped me figure things out and correct the mistakes.

## Why is this useful in real life?
This kind of setup is common in real-world Linux environments, especially when multiple developers or team members need to work on shared projects. Setting up correct permissions avoids accidental edits or security issues. Learning this gives me confidence for working on servers or managing files in a team in the future.

## Final thoughts
Overall, I enjoyed doing this task. It gave me hands-on experience with real Linux commands that felt practical and useful. I feel more comfortable now working with the Linux terminal for user and permission management.
